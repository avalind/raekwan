Filtering of somatic variants
====

A collection of scripts used for post-processing of Mutect1 and Scalpel variants as well as for
filtering a collection of vcf-files from a amplicon panel based on a bed file generated from
the set of discovery variants. This is probably useless for most people. Deposited here for
scientific rigor, as the scripts generating any data used in publication should be publicly
available.
